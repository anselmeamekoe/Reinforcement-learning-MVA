# Reinforcement-learning-MVA

This repo contains my assignments/projects of the MVA Reinforcement-learning course. This course introduce the models and mathematical tools used in formalizing the problem of learning and decision-making under uncertainty, with particular focus on the frameworks of reinforcement learning and multi-arm bandit. I got 17/20 at the end of this course

Topics:

- Historical multi-disciplinary basis of reinforcement learning

- Markov decision processes and dynamic programming

- Stochastic approximation and Monte-Carlo methods

- Function approximation and statistical learning theory

- Approximate dynamic programming

- Introduction to stochastic and adversarial multi-arm bandit

- Learning rates and finite-sample analysis
