# Reinforcement-learning-MVA
This repo contains my assignments/projects of the MVA Reinforcement-learning course.
This course introduce the models and mathematical tools used in formalizing the problem of learning and decision-making under uncertainty, with particular focus on the frameworks of reinforcement learning and multi-arm bandit.
I got 17/20 at the end of this course
